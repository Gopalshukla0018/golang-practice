# Golang Practice

This repository contains my Go (Golang) learning journey â€” from basics to building backend projects.  
After working with the MERN stack, I'm now exploring Go to deepen my backend knowledge and understand performance, concurrency, and scalable API design.

You'll find simple programs, small utilities, and API experiments using Go frameworks like Gin and Fiber as I progress.
